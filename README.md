# Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor (RV32I) ‚Äì Verilog Implementation

This project implements a **single-cycle RISC-V processor** based on the RV32I instruction set architecture. The design executes each instruction in a single clock cycle and is written entirely in **Verilog HDL**.

The project is aimed at understanding processor datapaths, control logic, and instruction execution in a minimal yet complete RISC-V CPU.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Supports key RV32I instructions:
  - Arithmetic: `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `SLL`, `SRL`, etc.
  - Immediate: `ADDI`, `ANDI`, `ORI`, `XORI`, etc.
  - Load/Store: `LW`, `SW`
  - Branch: `BEQ`, `BNE`
  - Jump: `JAL`, `JALR`
  - Other: `LUI`, `AUIPC`
- Single clock-cycle per instruction execution
- Modular Verilog design for clarity and reusability
